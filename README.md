# Xilinx Timing Report Analyzer

> NOTE: Every code and doc in this repo is created by **Github Copilot CLI** w/ **claude-sonnet-4.5** model

A purely AI Generated VSCode extension for offline analyzing Xilinx .twr (Timing Report) files and highlighting and visualizing critical timing paths. You can typically use it for dealing with .twr files generated by Xilinx tools calling from third-party environments(like *NI LabVIEW FPGA*, etc) where you don't have Vivado installed.

## Features

- **📊 Interactive Timing Graph**: Visualize timing paths with zoom/pan support
- **🎯 Smart Path Highlighting**: Automatic highlighting of timing paths at cursor position
- **🔍 Detailed Hover Information**: Comprehensive timing data on hover
- **⚡ Three-Path Visualization**: Shows source clock, data path, and destination clock separately
- **🖱️ Zoom & Pan Controls**: Mouse wheel zoom, click-drag pan, keyboard shortcuts
- **🎨 Color-Coded Paths**: Failed paths in red, met paths in green, distinct clock paths
- **📝 Dual Format Support**: Works with both Vivado and ISE .twr files

## Quick Start

![demo](/docs/demo.gif)


## Usage

### Opening TWR Files
1. Open any `.twr` file in VSCode
2. The file is automatically recognized and syntax-highlighted

### Viewing Timing Graphs
1. Place cursor on any timing path in the `.twr` file
2. **Option 1**: Click the preview button (📊) in the editor toolbar
3. **Option 2**: Right-click → "Open Timing Graph to the Side"
4. **Option 3**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Xilinx: Show Timing Graph"

### Interactive Graph Controls
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out (zooms towards cursor position)
- **Click + Drag**: Pan around the graph
- **+/- Buttons**: Zoom controls in top-right corner
- **Reset Button**: Return to 100% zoom
- **Double-Click**: Reset view
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `+` or `=`: Zoom in
  - `-`: Zoom out
  - `0` or `r`: Reset view

### Path Highlighting
- Move cursor to any timing path
- Path automatically highlights with orange background
- Hover over elements for detailed timing information

## Supported File Formats

- **Vivado Timing Reports**: `.twr` files from Vivado 2018.x - 2024.x
- **ISE Timing Reports**: `.twr` files from ISE 14.x

## Graph Visualization

The extension displays timing paths in three distinct sections:

### 1. Source Clock Path (Blue)
- Clock generation and distribution
- From clock source (PLL, MMCM, GTYE4) to launch flip-flop
- Includes all clock buffers (BUFG, BUFGCE) and routing

### 2. Data Path (Red/Green)
- Combinational logic between flip-flops
- All logic cells and routing delays
- Red for failed paths, green for met paths

### 3. Destination Clock Path (Purple)
- Clock path to capture flip-flop
- Clock distribution network
- Shows setup/hold timing requirements

## Known Limitations

- Very large paths (>200 elements) may render slowly
- Hold timing paths not extensively tested
- Clock domain crossing analysis is informational only
